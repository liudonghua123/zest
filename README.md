# Project status

As mentioned at https://zestdocs.github.io/ I've now decided to stop maintaining Zest. Hence please do not expect updates or support. If anyone is insterested in continuing, feel free to contact me at the email from the commit messages. I'd be willing to transfer the zestdocs.org domain and Mac App Store app ownership in case someone shows more interest than me.

It [was certainly fun](https://medium.com/@jerzy.kozera/from-zeal-devdocs-to-zest-my-docs-journey-93fa4bf08a8f#.t59nt74b7) to implement this project, but sadly I don't have enough motivation to continue at this point. I feel obliged to let the users know about this decision, hence the notice.

# zest

Early Proof of Concept prototype. It's my first ClojureScript project ever, etc. Not really meant for release, published mostly in case someone wants to collaborate.

## Requirements

* JDK 1.7+
* Leiningen 2.5.3
* Recent node.js
* Lucene++ (available at https://github.com/luceneplusplus/LucenePlusPlus)
* libarchive
* [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/)

On Mac/Linux, installing node.js using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is recommended.

This project uses Electron v0.35.2. Please check [Electron's GitHub page](https://github.com/atom/electron) for the latest version. The version is specified in `Gruntfile.js` under the `Grunt Config` section.

## Setup

On Mac/Linux:

```
scripts/setup.sh
```

On Windows:

```
scripts\setup.bat
```

This will install the node dependencies for the project, along with grunt and bower and will also run `grunt setup`.


## Development mode

Start the figwheel server:

```
lein figwheel
```

If you are on OSX/Linux and have `rlwrap` installed, you can start the figwheel server with:

```
rlwrap lein figwheel
```

This will give better readline support.

More about [figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) here.


In another terminal window, launch the electron app:

```
grunt launch
```

You can edit the `src/cljs/zest/core.cljs` file and the changes should show up in the electron app without the need to re-launch.

## Using nREPL with figwheel

- Start the repl using `lein repl`.

```
user> (use 'figwheel-sidecar.repl-api)
nil
user> (def figwheel-config
        {:figwheel-options {:css-dirs ["app/css"]}
         :build-ids ["dev"]
         :all-builds
           [{:id "dev"
             :figwheel {:on-jsload "zest.core/on-figwheel-reload"}
             :source-paths ["src/cljs" "env/dev/cljs"]
             :compiler {:main "zest.dev"
                        :asset-path "js/p/out"
                        :output-to "app/js/p/app.js"
                        :output-dir "app/js/p/out" }}]})
#'user/figwheel-config
user> (start-figwheel! figwheel-config)
Figwheel: Starting server at http://localhost:3449
Figwheel: Watching build - dev
Compiling "resources/public/js/repler.js" from ["src/cljs" "env/dev/cljs"]...
Successfully compiled "app/js/p/app.js" in 2.06 seconds.

#<SystemMap>
```

See [Figwheel wiki](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/wiki/Using-the-Figwheel-REPL-within-NRepl) for more details.

## Dependencies

Node dependencies are in `package.json` file. Bower dependencies are in `bower.json` file. Clojure/ClojureScript dependencies are in `project.clj`.

## Icons

Please replace the icons provided with your application's icons. The development icons are from [node-appdmg](https://github.com/LinusU/node-appdmg) project.

Files to replace:

* app/img/logo.icns
* app/img/logo.ico
* app/img/logo_96x96.png
* scripts/dmg/TestBkg.png
* scripts/dmg/TestBkg@2x.png

## Creating a build for release

To create a Windows build from a non-Windows platform, please install `wine`. On OS X, an easy option is using homebrew.

On Windows before doing a production build, please edit the `scripts/build-windows-exe.nsi` file. The file is the script for creating the NSIS based setup file.

On Mac OSX, please edit the variables for the plist in `release-mac` task in `Gruntfile.js`.

Using [`electron-packager`](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager), we are able to create a directory which has OS executables (.app, .exe etc) running from any platform.

If NSIS is available on the path, a further setup executable will be created for Windows. Further, if the release command is run from a OS X machine, a DMG file will be created.

To create the release directories:

```
grunt release
```

This will create the directories in the `builds` folder.

Note: you will need to be on OSX to create a DMG file and on Windows to create the setup .exe file.

# Basic Proof of Concept usage

DevDocs downloader, Stack Overflow torrent downloader, and Stack Overflow indexer are now implemented in the "Settings" modal.

`extractor`, `sogrep`, and `searcher` binaries need to be in the root directory of this repo. (`extractor`+`sogrep` and `searcher` can be built from the `sogrep-src/` and `nodelucene/` directories respectively - `cmake . && make` should do it, given installed libarchive, xerces, leveldb, rapidjson, and Lucene++)
